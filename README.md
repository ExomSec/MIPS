# MIPS
Exom-MIPS is a mass IP scanner to scan a single or multiple (generated) IP addresses for a single port. The tool allows you to find IPs that have a certain port open. 
For example you could search for port 80 on one IP address or port 80 on multiple generated IPs such as 32.35.91.21, 32.35.91.22, 32.35.91.23, 32.35.91.24 etc.

The IP ranges are also very customizable so you can choose to scan with octet groups, with all octet groups or fully customized.

* Scan Octet group A
* Scan Octet group B
* Scan Octet group C
* Scan Octet group D
* Scan Octet group E
* Scan ALL groups
* Customaizible scan


The custom scan can do for example these:

> Use "x" to mark that that number is going to bee looped fully, so from 0 to 255.

> Use "-" to choose the gap, for example 192-195.x.x.x would scan from 192.0.0.0 to 195.255.255.255.
